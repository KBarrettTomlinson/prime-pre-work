//Discussion question of the week! ""Consider an electric drill.
//It can use different drill bits. It can be charging, idling, or in use.
//When in use it can be rotating clockwise or counter-clockwise.
//What would this object's prototype look like?
//What properties/methods would it have?""

function Drill(status, brand, voltage){
  this.drillBits = [];
  this.currentBit = string;
  this.status = status; //charging, idling, in-use
  this.rotation = boolean; //true is clockwise false is counter
  this.charge = this.reportCharge();
  this.torque = number; //can be 1 - 20
  this.brand = brand;
  this.voltage = voltage;

  this.addDrillBit = function(newBit){
    //pushes new bit to array this.drillBits
  }
  this.changeDrillBit = function(changeBit){
    //checks to see if bit you are changing to is new
    //calls this.addDrillBit if it is needed
    //changes this.currentBit
  }
